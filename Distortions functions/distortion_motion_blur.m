%% Function parameters:
% imgin: Original image
% name: name of the new distorted image
% len: Linear motion of camera, specified as a numeric scalar, measured in pixels
% angle: Angle of camera motion in degrees, specified as a numeric scalar.
% outputFolder: directory where are writted the new distorted image

%% Function distortion_motion_blur that performs a distortion representing an approximation of the linear motion of a camera 	

function [distortion, imG_out] = distortion_motion_blur(imgin,name,len,angle,outputFolder)

% Create predefined 2-D filter named blur_motion_filter

%% Create image to perform the blur motion distortion %%
