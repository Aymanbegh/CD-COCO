%% Function parameters:
% imgin: Original image.
% name: name of the new distorted image.
% gaussian_size: Size of the Gaussian filter, specified as a scalar or 2-element vector of positive, odd integers.
% gaussian_sigma: Standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution, specified as a positive number or a 2-element vector of positive numbers. 
% outputFolder: directory where are writted the new distorted image.

%% Function distortion_defocus_blur that performs a Gaussian lowpass filter that smooths image.
