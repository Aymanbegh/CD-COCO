%% Function parameters:
% imgin: Original image.
% name: name of the new distorted image.
% mean: Mean of Gaussian noise, specified as a numeric scalar.
% variance: Variance of Gaussian noise, specified as a numeric scalar.
% outputFolder: directory where are writted the new distorted image.

%% Function distortion_noise that adds a gaussian noise to image
