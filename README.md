# CD-COCO: Complex Distorted COCO database for Scene-Context-Aware computer vision

Here is an original strategy of image distortion generation applied to the MS-COCO dataset that combines some local and global distortions to reach a better realism. We have shown that training with this distorted dataset improves the robustness of models by 31.5% approximately through this full framework evaluation and training.

**Codes of evaluation and training tasks are fully provided as well as distorted dataset.**


Overview
-----------------------------------
we built this new versatile database derived from the well-known MS-COCO database to which we applied local and global photo-realistic distortions.
These new local distortions are generated by considering the scene context of the images that guarantees a high level of photo-realism. 
Distortions are generated by exploiting the depth information of the objects in the scene as well as their semantics. 
This guarantees a high level of photo-realism and allows to explore real scenarios ignored in conventional databases dedicated to various CV applications.
Our versatile database offers an efficient solution to improve the robustness of various CV tasks such as Object Detection (OD), scene segmentation, and distortion-type classification methods.

Furthermore, we propose a full framework generation of complexe photo-realistic distorted images applied on MS-COCO dataset.
The main contributions are:
-  New distortions with improved realism are introduced, describing common phenomena in computer vision through complex local and atmospheric distortions (see **Distorted dataset generation** section).
- This paper proposes efficient algorithms to generate local and global photorealistic distortions that are not included in any existing database. (see **Evaluation** section).
- A novel dataset is built from the MS-COCO dataset, dedicated to the improvement of the robustness of the OD and object segmentation models against a broad type of distortion.
- The image database, the proposed database scene classification index, and distortion generation codes are publicly available.


Image Distortions
-----------------------------------

- **Global distortions**: affect the image as a whole and come from different sources related in general to the acquisition conditions. Some are directly dependent on the physical characteristics of the camera and are of photometric or geometric origin. Among the most common distortions that affect the quality of the signal are defocusing blur, photon noise, geometric or chromatic aberrations, and blur due to the movement of the camera or the movement of objects. The other types of degradation are related to the environment and more particularly the lighting and atmospheric disturbances in the case of outdoor scenes. Compression and image transmission artifacts are another source of degradation that is difficult to control. These common distortions have been already considered in benchmarking the performance of some models.

- **Local distortions**: are undesirable signals affecting one or more localized areas in the image (see figure 1). A typical case is the blurring due to the movement of an object of relatively high speed. Another photometric distortion is the appearance of a halo around the object contours due to the limited sensitivity of the sensors or backlight illumination (BI). The artistic blur affecting a particular part of the targeted scene, the object to be highlighted by the pro-shooter, is another type of local distortion. Thus, integrating the local distortions in the database increases its size and makes it richer and more representative of scenarios close to real applications which improves the relevance of trained models.

Distorted dataset generation
-----------------------------------
Distortions are applied to 2 sets from the MS-COCO 2017 dataset => train (118K images) and validation (5K images) sets. 
**You generate yourself your COCO distorted dataset for the train and evaluation sets thanks to the following functions. Otherwise, you can download directly download our distorted dataset: (train set: GB) and (validation set: GB)**
- **Validation set**: We apply the 10 types of distortions on all images from the validation set of MS-COCO (5K images) through 10 distortion levels specified in each respective generation function ("distortion_*distortion_name*.m"). The values of distortions are giver directly in each specific distortion function ("dist_*distortion_name*.m"). All of these functions, present in the **Distortions_validation** folder, are in the following tree structure:

    ```
  Distortions_validation
  ├── Distortions functions
      └──distortion_*distortion_name*.m : function that generate the distortion specified by *distortion_name*
  ├── dist_*distortion_name*.m: functions that call each respective functions in the folder "Distortions functions" 
  ├── main.m: main script that calls all dist_*distortion_name*.m functions
  ```
**Download the Rain and Haze images sources to generate these distortion**: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PDlCD63W8myRbsaJTRjwYBVlt8X2uwaA?usp=sharing  
Paths to directories from the main script need to be modified in order to indicate the correct paths for the image source, the annotations sources and the desired output directories.

    %% Paths to directories
    %Path to validation set images from COCO 2017
    imgval_path='C:\Users\beghd\OneDrive\Bureau\Dataset\COCO\val2017';
    %Path to validation set annotations from COCO 2017
    path_annotation =('C:\Users\beghd\OneDrive\Bureau\Dataset\COCO\annotations_unpacked_valfull2017\matFiles');
    %Path to output directory where distortions are generated
    outputFolder=('C:\Users\beghd\OneDrive\Bureau\Dataset\COCO\val2017_d1/');
    %Path to the rain masks to apply for the rain distortion
    rainFolder=('C:\Users\beghd\OneDrive\Bureau\Distortions\video extraction\rain5/');
    %Path to the haze masks to apply for the haze distortion
    hazeFolder=('C:\Users\beghd\OneDrive\Bureau\Distortions\video extraction\fog1/');
    
To generate the desired distortion, comment or uncomment the lines of functions in the "main.m" script:

    %% Call of functions
    dist_defocus(imgval_path,path_annotation,outputFolder);
    dist_haze(imgval_path,path_annotation,outputFolder,hazeFolder);
    dist_motion(imgval_path,path_annotation,outputFolder);
    dist_rain(imgval_path,path_annotation,outputFolder,rainFolder);
    dist_object_motion(imgval_path,path_annotation,outputFolder);
    dist_object_illum(imgval_path,path_annotation,outputFolder);
    dist_object_defocus(imgval_path,path_annotation,outputFolder);
    dist_compression(imgval_path,path_annotation,outputFolder);
    dist_contraste(imgval_path,path_annotation,outputFolder);
    dist_noise(imgval_path,path_annotation,outputFolder);
    
The distorted images are as the following tree structure:   

      ```
      outputFolder: path given in the main script that described the output folder
      ├── noise
          └── Level 1 of distortion (value)
          ...
          ...
          └── Level 10 of distortion (value)
      ├── Next distortion  
          └── Level 1 of distortion (value)
          ...
          ...
          └── Level 10 of distortion (value)   
         ```
